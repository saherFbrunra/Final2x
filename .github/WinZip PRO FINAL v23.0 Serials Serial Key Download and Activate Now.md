The movie begins with a flashback of Ichigo Kurosaki's first encounter with a Hollow, a monstrous creature that devours human souls. Ichigo, who has the ability to see and interact with spirits, is saved by Rukia Kuchiki, a Soul Reaper who transfers her powers to him. This marks the beginning of Ichigo's journey as a substitute Soul Reaper, who fights against Hollows and other evil forces that threaten the balance between the worlds of the living and the dead.
 
In the present day, Ichigo and his friends are enjoying their peaceful lives in Karakura Town, when they are suddenly attacked by a group of masked men who call themselves Sinners. These Sinners are escaped prisoners from Hell, who have come to kidnap Ichigo's younger sister Yuzu for unknown reasons. Ichigo and his friends try to fight back, but they are overwhelmed by the Sinners' power and brutality.
 
Fortunately, they are rescued by KokutÅ, a mysterious man who claims to be a former Sinner who wants to help Ichigo. KokutÅ tells Ichigo that Yuzu has been taken to Hell, and that he can guide him there. He also warns him that Hell is a dangerous place where no Soul Reaper or Hollow can survive, and that he must be prepared to face unimaginable horrors and enemies.
 
Ichigo decides to go to Hell with KokutÅ, accompanied by his friends Rukia, UryÅ« Ishida, Yasutora \"Chad\" Sado, and Renji Abarai. They enter Hell through a portal created by KokutÅ's sword, and find themselves in a barren and desolate landscape filled with fire and lava. There, they encounter the KushanÄda, giant guardians of Hell who attack anyone who enters their territory.
 
As they make their way through Hell, they also face the Sinners who kidnapped Yuzu, led by Shuren, a powerful and ruthless Sinner who has a grudge against Ichigo. Shuren reveals that he plans to use Yuzu as a bait to lure out the ruler of Hell, known as the Skull King or the Will of Hell. Shuren believes that if he can defeat the Skull King, he can escape from Hell and take over the world.
 
Ichigo and his friends must stop Shuren's scheme and rescue Yuzu before it's too late. But they soon discover that there is more to KokutÅ than meets the eye, and that he has his own agenda and secrets. They also learn the truth about Hell and its origin, and how it is connected to Ichigo's past and destiny.
 
Bleach Movie 4: Hell Verse is a movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat with its stunning animation, epic battles, dramatic twists, and emotional moments. It is a movie that will make you laugh, cry, cheer, and gasp as you witness the ultimate showdown between good and evil in the depths of Hell.
