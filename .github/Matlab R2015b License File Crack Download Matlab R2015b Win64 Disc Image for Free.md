## What is a License File?
 
A license file is a specially formatted ASCII text file that contains encrypted product passcodes for each product you are licensed to run. Each product passcode identifies the number of keys available for that product. The network license manager grants or denies access to a product depending on the availability of the license keys associated with each product[^1^].
 
A license file can be either individual or network. An individual license file is associated with a specific computer and user account. A network license file is shared by multiple computers and users on a network. The type of license file you need depends on your license type and operating system.
 
## Where to Find a License File?
 
The location of your license file depends on your license type and operating system. The license location can also be stored in an environment variable. This is common for network licenses[^1^]. Here are some common locations for different license types and operating systems:
 
- Windows
    - Individual License: %AppData%\MathWorks\MATLAB\R20XXx\_licenses (Replace "R20XXx" with release number, e.g. R2021a.)
    - Network License: C:\Program Files\MATLAB\R20XXx\licenses
- MacOS
    - Individual License: /Users/$USER/Library/Application Support/MathWorks/MATLAB/R20XXx\_licenses (For R2016b and older, navigate to ~/.matlab instead.)
    - Network License: Right click, CTRL-click, or two-finger click on the MATLAB icon in your Applications folder and select "Show Package Contents." In the folder that opens up, open the "licenses" folder[^1^].
- Linux
    - Individual License: ~/.matlab/R20XXx\_licenses
    - Network License: $MATLAB/licenses (If MATLAB is installed in the default location, this is /usr/local/MATLAB/R20XXx/licenses)

If you cannot find your license file in these locations, you can contact MathWorks support or visit their website for more help.
 
## How to Use a License File?
 
To use a license file for Matlab R2015b, you need to install the network license manager on the server (for network licenses) or the Matlab software on the client computer (for individual or network licenses). During the installation process, you will be asked to provide the path to your license file or copy it to a specific location. The installer will process the license file and activate your Matlab products[^1^].
