# How to Install Windows Embedded POSReady 2009 MUI 29
 
Windows Embedded POSReady 2009 is a version of Windows XP that is designed for point-of-sale devices such as cash registers, kiosks, ATMs, and self-service terminals. It has a longer support life cycle than Windows XP and can run most of the same applications and drivers. However, it is not widely available for download and requires a valid product key to activate.

One of the features of Windows Embedded POSReady 2009 is that it supports multiple languages through Multilingual User Interface (MUI) packs. These packs allow users to switch the display language of the operating system and some applications without reinstalling or reformatting. However, not all languages are included in the default installation of Windows Embedded POSReady 2009. One of them is MUI 29, which corresponds to the language code zh-TW for Traditional Chinese (Taiwan).
 
If you want to install Windows Embedded POSReady 2009 MUI 29 on your device, you will need to follow these steps:
 
1. Download the ISO image of Windows Embedded POSReady 2009 from Microsoft's website[^1^] or from a trusted source. You will also need a product key to activate it. You can use one of the keys provided by some users on the Internet Archive[^1^] or on Microsoft Community[^2^], but be aware that they may not be legal or valid.
2. Burn the ISO image to a CD or DVD using a software such as ImgBurn or Rufus. Alternatively, you can use a virtual drive software such as Daemon Tools or Virtual CloneDrive to mount the ISO image as a virtual CD or DVD.
3. Insert the CD or DVD into your device and boot from it. Follow the instructions on the screen to install Windows Embedded POSReady 2009. You may need to change the boot order in your BIOS settings to make your device boot from the CD or DVD.
4. When prompted, enter the product key that you obtained in step 1. If the key is valid, you will be able to proceed with the installation. If not, you will need to find another key or contact Microsoft for support.
5. After the installation is complete, you will need to download and install Windows Embedded POSReady 2009 MUI 29 from ashtangayoga.ie[^3^]. This is a PDF file that contains a link to download the MUI pack from Microsoft's website. You will need to have Adobe Reader or another PDF reader installed on your device to open it.
6. Run the MUI pack installer and follow the instructions on the screen. You may need to restart your device after the installation is complete.
7. To change the display language to Traditional Chinese (Taiwan), go to Control Panel > Regional and Language Options > Languages > Details > Settings > Default input language and select Chinese (Taiwan) from the drop-down menu. Click OK and apply the changes.
