- Reading hadiths is a way of following and loving the Prophet (peace be upon him), who is the best example for us. Allah says in the Quran: "There has certainly been for you in the Messenger of Allah an excellent pattern for anyone whose hope is in Allah and the Last Day and [who] remembers Allah often." (Quran 33:21)
- Reading hadiths is a way of learning and understanding the Quran, which is the word of Allah. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "I have left among you two things which will never lead you astray: the Book of Allah and my Sunnah." (Reported by al-Hakim)
- Reading hadiths is a way of increasing our faith and wisdom, as well as purifying our hearts and souls. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "Whoever studies and memorizes the hadiths will be endowed by Allah with a luminous face, filled with the jet of faith which signifies peace of mind and inner shade." (Reported by al-Bayhaqi)
- Reading hadiths is a way of attaining guidance and success in this life and the next. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "Whoever revives a Sunnah of mine that has died out after I am gone, he will have a reward equivalent to that of those among the people who act upon it, without that detracting from their reward in the slightest." (Reported by al-Tirmidhi)
- Reading hadiths is a way of earning the intercession and companionship of the Prophet (peace be upon him) on the Day of Judgment. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "The people who will be closest to me on the Day of Resurrection will be those who have read the most hadiths." (Reported by Ibn Hibban)

These are some of the benefits and virtues of reading hadiths, which show us how important and valuable this practice is. We should strive to read hadiths regularly, with sincerity and reflection, and to act upon them according to our best ability. May Allah make us among those who love and follow the Sunnah of His beloved Messenger (peace be upon him).
