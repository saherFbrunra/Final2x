## How to Install Citra on Android
 
If you want to play 3DS games on your Android device, you will need to install Citra, the official 3DS emulator for Android. Citra is available on the Google Play Store, and it supports most of the popular 3DS games. However, before you can start playing, you will also need to have some 3DS ROMs that you legally own and dump yourself from your own cartridges. In this article, we will show you how to install Citra on Android and how to load and play 3DS games on it.
 
Here are the basic steps for how to install Citra on Android:
 
1. Download the app from the Google Play Store[^1^]. You can also scan the QR code below to go directly to the download page.
2. Open the app and grant permission requests. The app will ask for storage access and microphone access. The former is needed to read and write game files, while the latter is needed for online voice chat.
3. Select the folder that contains your 3DS ROMs. You can use the built-in file browser or a third-party file manager app to do this. Make sure your ROMs are decrypted[^1^]. You can also create subfolders to organize your games by genre, region, etc.
4. Tap on a game to launch it. You will see a loading screen with some information about the game. You can also access the game settings by tapping on the three dots icon at the top right corner.
5. Enjoy playing 3DS games on your Android device. You can use the touchscreen or a compatible controller to control the game. You can also adjust the screen layout, graphics, audio, and input settings from the in-game menu by swiping from the left edge of the screen.

That's it! You have successfully installed Citra on Android and learned how to play 3DS games on it. If you have any questions or issues, you can check out the official Citra website[^2^] or join their Discord server[^2^] for more help and support.
