# How to Debug SCSI Miniport Drivers with WinDbg
 
SCSI miniport drivers are responsible for communicating with SCSI devices such as hard disks, tape drives, CD-ROMs, and scanners. They work with the SCSI port driver (Scsiport.sys) to handle requests from the I/O system and send commands to the devices.

Debugging SCSI miniport drivers can be challenging, especially when dealing with complex scenarios such as timeouts, errors, interrupts, and power management. Fortunately, WinDbg provides some useful tools and extensions to help you troubleshoot SCSI miniport drivers and identify the root cause of problems.
 
## Setting Up WinDbg for SCSI Debugging
 
To debug SCSI miniport drivers with WinDbg, you need to have the following:
 
- A target computer that runs Windows and has a SCSI device connected to a SCSI adapter.
- A host computer that runs WinDbg and has a connection to the target computer via a serial cable, USB cable, network, or other means.
- The symbol files for Scsiport.sys and your SCSI miniport driver. You can download the symbol files from the Microsoft Symbol Server or copy them from the Windows Driver Kit (WDK).
- The source code for your SCSI miniport driver (optional but recommended).

Once you have these components, you need to configure WinDbg to use them. Here are the steps:

1. On the target computer, enable kernel debugging and set the baud rate for the serial connection. You can use the bcdedit command or the System Configuration utility (msconfig.exe) to do this. For example:

        bcdedit /debug on
        bcdedit /dbgsettings serial debugport:1 baudrate:115200

2. On the host computer, launch WinDbg and select File > Kernel Debug. In the Kernel Debugging dialog box, select the appropriate connection type (such as Serial) and enter the port number and baud rate that match the target computer. Click OK.
3. In WinDbg, set the symbol path to include the location of the Scsiport.sys and your SCSI miniport driver symbol files. You can use the .sympath command or the File > Symbol File Path menu option to do this. For example:

        .sympath SRV*c:\symbols*https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols;c:\mydriver\symbols

4. In WinDbg, reload the symbols for Scsiport.sys and your SCSI miniport driver. You can use the .reload command or the Debug > Reload menu option to do this. For example:

        .reload scsiport.sys
        .reload mydriver.sys

5. In WinDbg, set breakpoints in your SCSI miniport driver code where you want to inspect the state of the driver or device. You can use the bp command or the Debug > New Breakpoint menu option to do this. For example:

        bp mydriver!HwStartIo
        bp mydriver!HwInterrupt

## Using WinDbg Extensions for SCSI Debugging
 
WinDbg provides some useful extensions for debugging SCSI miniport drivers. These extensions are part of Minipkd.dll, which is included in the WDK. To load Minipkd.dll, use the .load command in WinDbg. For example:

    .load minipkd

Some of the most common Minipkd.dll extensions are:

- !minipkd.help: Displays a list of all Minipkd.dll extension commands.
- !minipkd.adapters: Displays all the adapters that work with Scsiport.sys and their associated devices.
- !minipkd.adapter Adapter: Displays detailed information about a specified adapter.
- !minipkd.lun Lun: Displays detailed information about a specified logical unit number (LUN).
- !minipkd.srb Srb: Displays detailed information about a specified SCSI request block (SRB).

You can use these extensions to examine various aspects of your
