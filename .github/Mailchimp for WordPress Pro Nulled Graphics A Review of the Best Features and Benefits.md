Mailchimp for WordPress Pro Nulled Graphics is available for free download from various websites that offer nulled plugins, themes and scripts. However, using nulled plugins can be risky for your site security, performance and reputation. You may also miss out on important updates, features and support from the original developers.
  
Therefore, we recommend that you use the official version of Mailchimp for WordPress Premium instead of Mailchimp for WordPress Pro Nulled Graphics. The official version is licensed under the GNU GPL for an unlimited number of sites, comes with professional technical support and guarantees a 100% working and safe product.
