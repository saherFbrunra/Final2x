## What is Pumper VST Plugin?
  
Pumper is a dynamic processor that combines three essential effects: compression, saturation, and stereo enhancement. It is designed to make your sound more punchy, warm, and spacious with minimal effort. You can use it on any instrument, vocal, or mix bus to add some character and energy to your sound.
  
Pumper has a simple and intuitive interface that lets you adjust the amount of processing with one knob. You can also tweak the individual parameters of each effect by clicking on the icons below the knob. Here is a brief overview of what each effect does:
  
- **Compression:** This effect reduces the dynamic range of your sound, making it more consistent and loud. You can choose from four different compression modes: FAT, CLEAN, SOFT, and HARD. Each mode has a different character and response time. You can also adjust the attack and release times of the compressor.
- **Saturation:** This effect adds some harmonic distortion to your sound, making it more warm and rich. You can choose from four different saturation modes: ANALOG, WARM, BRIGHT, and HARD. Each mode has a different tone and amount of distortion. You can also adjust the drive and tone of the saturation.
- **Stereo Enhancement:** This effect widens the stereo image of your sound, making it more spacious and immersive. You can choose from four different stereo modes: MONO, STEREO, WIDE, and SUPER WIDE. Each mode has a different width and phase correlation. You can also adjust the width and balance of the stereo enhancement.

Pumper VST plugin is compatible with Windows and Mac OS X systems. It works with any DAW that supports VST or AU plugins.
