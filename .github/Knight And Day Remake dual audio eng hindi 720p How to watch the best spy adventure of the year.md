So, what do the critics and the audience think of Bang Bang!? Well, the reviews are mixed, to say the least. Some praised the film for its stunning visuals, thrilling action and sizzling chemistry between Hrithik and Katrina, while others criticized it for its weak plot, poor direction and lack of originality.
 
According to IMDb, the film has a rating of 5.5 out of 10, based on 16,113 user votes. The user reviews are also divided, with some calling it a "fun ride" and others calling it a "waste of time". One user wrote: "I have been waiting for this since the time I saw the trailer of it. I hadn't liked the songs - but hey, lovely promos. So, when movie released I booked the tickets for Thursday night. I opened my twitter and FB on Thursday morning and in came the flow of negative reviews of the film. All the leading reviewers gave it 1.5 star. User reviews were still not available. My heart sank. I saw my 1000 bucks going in drainage. I checked to see if I can cancel my ticket - there wasn't any option. Wife said - no worries we'll see how it goes. I said to myself - well, it can't go poorer than Himmatwala that I had seen. I also did one more thing - I saw Knight and Day again in afternoon. I went in to see the film with my wife, sister and mother in law. I honestly had no expectations from the film after all the reviews I had read. After 80 minutes in the movie, we went for interval. I looked at my wife with an expression - \"what the f\*\*K all the negative reviews were about\"? It was an entertaining first half and I was wondering if rest of the guys saw the same film? We decided to wait and finish the entire film and see if they have goofed it up anywhere in second part. After another 80 minutes or so, I was convinced, the reviews that I had been reading since morning were either mostly paid reviews or the people went in expecting a James Cameron film."[^1^]
 
According to Filmfare, the film has a rating of 3 out of 5 stars, based on their critic's review. The review stated: "Truth is Siddharth Anandâs slick spy thriller is all gloss and no substance. The adaptation, the changes, the so-called tweaking of the original screenplay / story just doesnât work... Not that Bang Bang! isnât well-made. Its technical craft is top notch... But thatâs about it."[^2^]
 
According to Koimoi, the film has a rating of 2 out of 5 stars, based on their critic's review. The review stated: "Bang Bang is everything that Knight and Day was about and nothing even remotely as exciting as the original. It isnât bland or boring just doesnât match up to my expectations of the film... Gorgeous stunts, picturesque locales and a paper thin script might create a watchable film but it wonât be a brilliant or memorable watch."[^3^]
 
According to Times of India, the film has a rating of 3 out of 5 stars, based on their critic's review. The review stated: "Siddharth Anand's Bang Bang makes more noise and little sense... This desi adaptation of the 2010 Tom Cruise-Cameron Diaz action thriller, Knight And Day, has charm in abundance... But it lacks coherence."[^4^]
 
So, there you have it. Bang Bang! is a film that you may enjoy if you are looking for some mindless entertainment and eye candy, but don't expect much from it in terms of story or logic.
