To add your own game ROMs to the cabinets, consoles and handhelds, you need to click on them and then click on the "Edit" button at the bottom. This will open a window where you can browse for your ROM files and assign them to different buttons. You can also change the artwork, title and description of each game.

Now that you have set up your own arcade room with your favorite game ROMs, you are ready to play them in VR or non-VR mode. To play in VR mode, you need to have a compatible VR headset like HTC Vive or Oculus Rift connected to your PC. The game will automatically detect your VR device and adjust the settings accordingly.
 
To play in non-VR mode, you just need to launch the game normally without any VR device connected. The game will run in full-screen mode on your monitor and you can use your keyboard and mouse or a controller to play.
 
In both modes, you can explore your arcade room freely and interact with various objects like
